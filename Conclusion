# Limitations
With any research project comes any number of limitations and problems that come up throughout the process of the work. We had a few specific limitations that we needed to address and adapt to work out solutions to get around them.
The first problem we encountered was data collection. At first, our group was planning on using the profootballreference.com website to retreive all of our necessary data. However, we quickly discovered that the salary values that were being used were not just rookie contracts. Since we were working with data from 2014 - 2019 NFL seasons, some of the rookie players in those years had already acquired new contracts that were not their rookie value, thus invalidating any results and conclusions we planned to make in relation to rookie contracts. With this issue, we found another data source spotrac.com, where we were able to acquire the rookie information and salary values (in USD) for all NFL rookies in the 2019 - 2021 NFL seasons. Thus, with a simple change in years being studied and a new data source, we were able to overcome this limitation.
The second problem we encountered was the use of the parametric shortcut for ANOVA. Our original plan was to try a parametric shortcut ANOVA model after checking our assumptions, but once we had created our plots for gaussian residuals assumptions and homoscadesticity, we quickly realized that these two assumptions failed very badly. We then tried to add transformations which only appeared to make the plots worse. Thus, this left us to continue with the nonparametric shortcut.
  
After further considerations, we realized that the nonparametric shortcut also would not work due to our lack of independence of observations, since draft pick order does affect salary value. Thus, we had to make one final switch to include draft pick order into our model, leaving our group with the ANCOVA method as our choice of study. 
Even though we encountered very important limitations through our research, we were able to adapt quickly and make-up the work we needed to complete in order to produce a proper ANCOVA analysis for NFL Rookie Salary Values.

# ANOVA Model
# F
The College of a specific NFL rookie accounts for about XX times as much variation in total rookie salary value (USD) as our residuals, even when we account for the year the rookie was drafted and the order in which they were selected. 
# P-value
Under the null hypothesis that College has no impact on NFL rookie salary value (USD), we would only anticipate such a result XX% of the time (p = XX). 
# Omega Squared for Year
The Year that an NFL rookie is drafted accounts for a XX of the variation in NFL rookie salary value (USD) with around XX%.
# Point Estimates
After accounting for the impact of the year an NFL rookie was drafted, as well as the order in which they were selected, our group of NFL rookies who were selected out of XX accumulated XX (more or less) NFL rookie salary value (USD) per rookie beyond the general baseline expectations.

# Effect Sizes 

# Cohen's d
NFL Rookies that were selected from XX have NFL rookie salary values (USD) that are XX standard deviations (higher/lower) than NFL rookies who were selected from XX.

# Hedge's g
NFL Rookies that were selected from XX have NFL rookie salary values (USD) that are XX standard deviations (higher/lower) than NFL rookies who were selected from XX.

# Probability of Superiority
If we were to run two lotteries to select an NFL rookie from XX1 and another NFL rookie from XX2, our XX1 rookie will have a higher NFL rookie salary value XX% of the time.

# Pairwise Comparisons

# Hodges Lehmann
Half of all pairwise comparisons between NFL rookies selected from XX1 and NFL rookies selected from XX2 have a difference of XX total NFL rookie salary value, in USD.
